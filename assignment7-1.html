        <p><a class="bartok" href="https://IvyFromISU.github.io/CTK301/assignment1.html">Dan Flashes.</a> I give up on making nav look right. I'd much rather deal with the missing points from not messing with it than to keep messing with nav. Also I have no idea who any of the people in the images are. Crawling in my skin. These wounds, they will not heal. Fear is how I fall. Confusing what is real. There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface. Consuming, confusing. This lack of self control I fear is never ending. Controlling. I can't seem. To find myself again. My walls are closing in (Without a sense of confidence, I'm convinced) (That there's just too much pressure to take). I've felt this way before. So insecure. Crawling in my skin. These wounds, they will not heal. Fear is how I fall. Confusing what is real. Discomfort, endlessly has pulled itself upon me. Distracting, reacting. Against my will I stand beside my own reflection. It's haunting. How I can't seem. To find myself again. My walls are closing in (Without a sense of confidence, I'm convinced) (That there's just too much pressure to take). I've felt this way before. So insecure. Crawling in my skin. These wounds, they will not heal. Fear is how I fall. Confusing what is real. Crawling in my skin. These wounds, they will not heal. Fear is how I fall. Confusing, confusing what is real. There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface. Consuming (confusing what is real). This lack of self control I fear is never ending. Controlling (confusing what is real).</p>
        <p><a class="bartok" href="https://IvyFromISU.github.io/CTK301/assignment3.html">Shops at the Creeks.</a> I'm tired of being what you want me to be. Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface. Don't know what you're expecting of me. Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes. Every step that I take is another mistake to you (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow). I've become so numb. I can't feel you there. Become so tired. So much more aware. I'm becoming this. All I want to do. Is be more like me. And be less like you. Can't you see that you're somthering me. Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control? 'Cause everything that you thought I would be. Has fallen apart right in front of you. Every step that I take is another mistake to you (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow). And every second I waste is more than I can take. I've become so numb. I can't feel you there. Become so tired. So much more aware. I'm becoming this. All I want to do. Is be more like you. And be less like you.</p>
        <p>And I know. I may end up failing too. But I know. You were just like me with someone disappointed in you. I've become so numb. I can't feel you there. Become so tired. So much more aware. I'm becoming this. All I want to do. Is be more like me. And be less like you. I've become so numb. I can't feel you there (I'm tired of being what you want me to be). I've become so numb. I can't feel you there (I'm tired of being what you want me to be).</p>
